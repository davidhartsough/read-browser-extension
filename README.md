# Let Me Read

_The browser extension for reading_

It's simple: remove everything; just show the text.

1. Go to a web page that you'd like to read
1. Activate the extension (by clicking the browser extension's icon in your browser's top bar)
1. Read

---

The "Let Me Read" browser extension will grab all the important text from the page you're wanting to read and then place it in a nice reader that completely replaces the current web page that you're on. All that's left is text for you to read :)
